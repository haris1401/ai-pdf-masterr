## Running as a Desktop Application

You can now run the AI Console as a desktop-like application using your default browser's "App Mode".

### Launching the App
Run the following command in the project root:
```bash
backend\venv\Scripts\python desktop_app.py
```
This will:
1.  Start the backend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.
2.  Automatically launch Microsoft Edge (or Chrome) in "App Mode" (a window without an address bar), giving you a native desktop app experience.
